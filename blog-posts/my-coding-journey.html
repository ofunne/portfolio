      <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
      <h4>Just imagine that there's an actual blog post here...</h4>

    <div class="page" id="blog-body">
      <p>Hypothetically, this would be a blog post about my coding journey. I'll probably actually get to writing a post one day, but for now, this is all I've got :)</p>
      <p>The blog section is intended to mostly be a space for me to share my thoughts and experiences. 
        For example, you can expect to see some book and movie reviews.
        Most likely I'll do a monthly/seasonal media wrap-up which summarises all the media I've consumed, including books, movies, short films, articles etc.</p>
      <p>But for now, this page simply serves as proof that my website actually works!</p>
      <p>If you got to reading this article, please do head over to the contact page and send me a message to let me know how you liked it.</p>
